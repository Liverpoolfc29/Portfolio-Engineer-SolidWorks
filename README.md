**Description:**  
development of the project from the concept to a complete set of documentation for the manufacture of the structure.
- development of the concept or implementation of the architect's idea,
- creation of a 3D model,
- Creation of DXF files for cutting,
- Creation of CNC files for manufacturing,
- Creating a cutting list,
- Creating a parts list,
- Creating drawings:
-Welding,
-Bending,
-Assembly,
-Drilling and machining,
-Installation.
And other documents at the request of the customer.
